        To reduce costs and keep our fares cheap, we offer free online check-in
        options. Online check-in is available from

        time if you have <strong>purchased a seat</strong> during your booking.

        In case you have not purchased any seats with your booking, check-in
        will become available <strong>only 24 hours</strong> before departure.
